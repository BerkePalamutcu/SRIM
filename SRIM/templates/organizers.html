      <h3>Politehnica University of Timișoara</h3>
      <p class="organizer-text">
        Established in 1920, shortly after the union of Romanian territories, in
        a European context marked by the redefinition of states and by the
        aftermath of World War I, the Polytechnic School in Timisoara – as was
        originally called – was the answer to one of the requirements of the
        Romanian society of the time, namely the formation of engineers.
      </p>
      <p class="organizer-text">
        Interested in responding to the labor market demands and to the need for
        long-life training and development required by the complex challenges of
        the modern society, the portfolio of specializations offered by the
        Politehnica University Timisoara meets the needs of contemporary
        society, reflecting the close relationship the university holds with the
        socio-economic environment.
